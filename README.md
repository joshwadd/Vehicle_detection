# Classic Vehicle Detection

## Project Overview

This project builds a vehicle detection pipeline using classic techniques from computer vision and machine learning. Such techniques have fell out of favour in recent times and instead deep learning systems trained end to end have shown to produce better performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency of implementation. The point of this project then (aside from nostalgia)
